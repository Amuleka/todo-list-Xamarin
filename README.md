# Overview
In this personal project, I wanted to build a TodolisApp to keep track of my daily activities. Some times you forget to do certain things that are important and making this app was a good reminder to keep track of the most important activities

The app is very user-friendly. It has an add item field, so the user can add their daily activities, as well as remove and check or un-check the actions that have been completed

My purpose was to use my time wisely and divide my activities into categories so I know what I've done or what I will need to do during my day

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio with the Xamarin Forms framework to complete this project
I used C# to build the back end of my app

# Useful Websites

* [Xamarin Forms](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/xamarin/xamarin-forms) 
* [Xamarin Forms Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/)

# Future Work

* I will need to style the interface more depending on the customer's expectations
* I could use an API to add the todo items to the preferred calendar
* I could build more pages to add other categories like weekly, monthly, etc
